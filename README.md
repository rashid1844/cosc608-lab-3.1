# Arduino Sensors

### Touch Sensor:
it's a simple digitals sensor that OUTPUTs  High is the sensor is touched, and Low otherwise.
The code has an if function that if sensor is touched it will output "Touched" in the serial terminalwhich can be view on the PC itself or by connecting a terminal monitor to the arduino,also when sensor is touched it will turn on the led in pin 13.



### Ultrasonic Sensor:
It measures destance of objects from the sensor by sending an ultrasonic ping, and measuring 
the duration of the echo "response", which can be conveted to 'cm' based on the speed of sound.
